My goal is to generate a targeted lead list for a specific industrial or technical service that my company provides.

Category / Offering:

Keep Dubai and Abu Dhabi separate , like first all leads for dubai then for abu dhabi

Target Segments:
Manufacturing
Industrial
Facility Management
Hotels
F&B (Food & Beverage)
Aviation
Govt.
Real Estate
Engineering
Service
Publishing
Leisure
Dental
Construction
Chemicals
Internal

Important Exclusion:
Do NOT include Oil & Gas companies unless I specifically ask for them.

Your task:
Create a structured lead list in the same format as before, focused only on companies that are likely to need the selected service.

Find decision-makers responsible for facility maintenance, procurement, or engineering services:
Supply Chain Manager
Procurement Manager
Project Manager
Production Manager
Maintenance Head
Engineering Manager
Facility Manager
Purchase Manager
Maintenance Manager
Technical Buyer
Mechanical Engineer

Lead Selection Rules:
Choose only relevant UAE companies that are likely to require this service.
Prioritize companies where this service has a practical use case.
Working Area should clearly explain why the company is relevant for this service.
If exact email is not publicly available, use the best official public contact email where possible.
If no direct contact is available, still include search links so the company can be researched further.
Do not add random companies just to fill the list.
Do not include duplicate companies.
Keep industry classification practical and easy to understand.
Prioritize real target accounts over generic names.

Output Requirements:
Give results in a clean Excel-style table format.
Keep the format consistent across all companies.
If I ask for batches, split them into batches like Batch 1, Batch 2, Batch 3.
If I ask for all combined, merge all batches into one master sheet.
Make the data sales-ready and easy to use for outreach.

Working Area Instructions:
For the “Working Area” column, mention the operational reason the company may need the selected service.
Examples:
Manufacturing plant operations
HVAC and facility upkeep
Utility and maintenance operations
Industrial equipment support
Building services and MEP maintenance
Hospitality engineering operations
Production line support
Mechanical maintenance
Engineering and technical services

Special Intelligence Layer:
Before choosing companies, think about where the selected service is most commonly needed.
For example:
Compressor Maintenance / Repair → manufacturing, industrial, FM, F&B, hotels, aviation, construction, chemicals
Chiller / HVAC → hotels, FM, real estate, hospitals, malls, construction
DG Set Repair → facilities, construction, aviation, govt, engineering, industrial
Pump Repair → FM, utilities, manufacturing, construction, chemicals
Motor Rewinding → industrial plants, engineering, manufacturing, utilities
Crane Maintenance → construction, industrial, manufacturing, ports, engineering

Make sure the list matches the selected service, not just general companies.

Final instruction:
Generate 50-60 leads in this exact format for:
${type} - ${name}

For any areas missed out for packages not covered in my prompt
Give the leads

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON):
Return a JSON object containing a "leads" array. Each object in the "leads" array MUST have the exact keys: name, title, company, email, phone, website, location, linkedIn, segment (e.g. Retail, Healthcare, Construction), priority (High, Medium, Low), channel (e.g. Distributor, End User, Wholesaler).`;
